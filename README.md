# 🚩 Detecting Anti-India Campaign on Digital Platforms

## 📌 Problem Statement

With the rapid growth of social media and digital platforms, malicious actors are leveraging these spaces to spread misinformation, propaganda, and anti-national sentiments.
The challenge is to **build an AI-driven system that can detect and analyze Anti-India campaigns on digital platforms** by monitoring text, images, videos, and network behavior in real-time.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Detect and classify **anti-India content** from social media (Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, etc.).
* Identify **coordinated campaigns** (bots, fake accounts, foreign influence).
* Track **sentiment trends, hashtags, and misinformation networks**.
* Generate **real-time alerts** with supporting evidence.

---

## 🏗️ Implementation Structure

### 1. **Data Collection Layer**

* APIs: Twitter API (X), YouTube Data API, Reddit API, Facebook Graph API.
* Web scraping for open forums & news comments.
* Stream real-time posts with relevant keywords/hashtags.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**

* Text cleaning: remove stopwords, hashtags, URLs.
* Language detection (support for Hindi, English, regional languages).
* Translation API (Google / IndicTrans2).
* Multimedia handling:

  * OCR for extracting text from memes/images.
  * ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) for video/audio content.

### 3. **Feature Engineering**

* **Text Features:** sentiment, toxicity, propaganda detection.
* **Network Features:** retweet/reply graphs, bot likelihood scores.
* **Hashtag Trends:** sudden spikes → coordinated campaign suspicion.
* **User Behavior:** multiple accounts posting same content.

### 4. **Modeling Layer**

* **Text Classification Models:**

  * BERT / IndicBERT / mBERT for multilingual classification.
  * Fine-tuned on custom dataset (pro-India, neutral, anti-India).
* **Misinformation Detection Models:**

  * Fact-checking pipelines (Knowledge Graph + LLM-based claim verification).
* **Bot & Campaign Detection:**

  * Graph-based anomaly detection (NetworkX, PyTorch Geometric).
  * Time-series clustering for coordinated posts.

### 5. **Alert & Monitoring Dashboard**

* Frontend: React + Tailwind (real-time dashboard).
* Backend: Django/Flask + REST APIs.
* Features:

  * Heatmap of activity.
  * Trending hashtags.
  * Campaign network graph visualization.
  * Evidence logs for flagged content.

### 6. **Deployment**

* Containerized using Docker.
* Deployed on **cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure)** for scalability.
* Streamlit / Dash for prototype visualization.

## 📊 Example Workflow

1. **Input:** Live Twitter feed with hashtags like `#BoycottIndia`, `#FreeKashmir`.
2. **Processing:**

   * Detect sentiment → highly negative.
   * Detect propaganda phrases → matches anti-national lexicon.
   * User activity → multiple accounts amplifying same content.
3. **Output:** System flags this as a **coordinated anti-India campaign** and raises an alert.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Data Collection:** Tweepy, PRAW, Scrapy, Google Cloud APIs
* **NLP Models:** HuggingFace Transformers (BERT, mBERT, IndicBERT)
* **Vision Models:** Tesseract OCR, CLIP for meme analysis
* **Audio Models:** Whisper (OpenAI) for speech-to-text
* **Backend:** Flask/Django + FastAPI
* **Database:** PostgreSQL + ElasticSearch (for fast text search)
* **Visualization:** React + D3.js / Streamlit
* **Deployment:** Docker + AWS/GCP

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

* Multi-modal propaganda detection (text + video + meme).
* Deepfake detection (GAN-based media forgeries).
* Real-time fact-check integration with Indian news sources.
* Integration with law-enforcement dashboards for actionable insights.
